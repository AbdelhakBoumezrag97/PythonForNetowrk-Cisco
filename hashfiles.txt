#The code above calculates the MD5 digest of the file. 

#The file is opened in rb mode, which means that you are going to read the file in binary mode. 

#This is because the MD5 function needs to read the file as a sequence of bytes. 

#This will make sure that you can hash any type of file, not only text files.

#It is important to notice the read function. 

#When it is called with no arguments, like in this case, it will read all the contents of the file and load them into memory. 

#This is dangerous if you are not sure of the file's size.
